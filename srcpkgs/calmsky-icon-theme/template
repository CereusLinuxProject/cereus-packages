# IMPORTANT NOTE: the original GitHub repository was put as private by the creator, so this template uses an outdated
# fork made by KF_Art when he made a pull request. The template will not be removed as the creator will update the
# repository soon (or that's we expect). In cereus-extra will be still available the last build of this icon theme.
